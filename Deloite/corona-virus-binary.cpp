/*
Problem Statement :

Every decimal number can be changed into its binary form. Suppose your computer has itâ€™s own CoronaVirus, that eats binary digits from the right side of a number. Suppose a virus has 6 spikes, it will eat up 6 LSB binary digits in your numbers.
You will have a bunch of numbers, and your machine will have a virus with n spikes, you have to calculate what will be the final situation of the final numbers.

Input Format:
First line, a single Integer N
Second line N space separated integers of the bunch of values as array V
Third line a single integer n, the number of spikes in Corona for Computer

Output Format:
Single N space separated integers denoting the final situation with the array v.
